## 🌟 What is This Project?

**Operating-System** is a modular, extensible, and educational operating system project crafted by [Maazfr](https://github.com/Maazfr). It features a range of classic OS concepts—brought to life in real code. Dive deep into the mechanics of processes, memory, file systems, and more, all while learning practical systems programming skills!

## ✨ Features

- **🧠 Process Management**: Create, schedule, and switch between processes
- **💾 Memory Management**: Explore allocation strategies, paging, and memory protection
- **📁 Custom File System**: FAT file system tools and operations
- **🔗 Inter-Process Communication & Synchronization**: Signals, messaging, and safe concurrency
- **🛠️ Bootloader & Kernel**: Low-level x86 boot and kernel code in Assembly, C, and C++
- **⚡ Emulator-Friendly**: Rapid QEMU testing and debugging
- **🔧 Automated Builds**: Python, Bash, and SCons scripts for streamlined development

## 🚩 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- GCC toolchain (cross or native)
- `qemu-system-i386`
- Python 3.x, SCons
- NASM, mtools
- (Optional but recommended) parted, sh, and more

Install everything you need in one go:
```bash
cd Scripts
./install_deps.sh
```

### 2. Building the OS

1. **Configure** your build in `Build_Scripts/config.py` if needed.
2. **Build your image**:
    ```bash
    scons
    ```

### 3. Run in QEMU!

```bash
cd Scripts
./run.sh disk ../image/os.img
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Tweak and hack on kernel code in `SRC/`, or expand your OS toolset via `tools/`.
